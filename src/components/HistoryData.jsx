            Trafford Metrovics Cricket Club, originally known as Metrovick Rugby
            Football and Cricket Club, has a rich history intertwined with the
            industrial heritage of Manchester. The club was established on May
            2, 1923, by 17 apprentices from the Metropolitan Vickers engineering
            company, aiming to provide sports facilities and opportunities to
            play rugby against other regional companies.

          <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
            In 1948, 25 years after the rugby section's inception, the club
            expanded to include a cricket section due to popular demand. This
            addition led to the renaming of the club as Metrovick Rugby Football
            and Cricket Club. Within two years, the cricket section was fielding
            three regular sides, engaging in friendly matches against other
            company teams in the area.
