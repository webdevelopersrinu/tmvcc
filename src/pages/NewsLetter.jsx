            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I am truly honored and privileged to step into the role of
              Chairman for Trafford Metrovics Cricket Club as of October 20,
              2024. My sincere thanks to each of you for this opportunity. I
              look forward to building on the foundations laid by our previous
              leadership to ensure our club continues to thrive, both on and off
              the field.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              With the launch of this first monthly newsletter for our cricket
              club section, we aim to increase visibility into club activities
              and provide monthly updates across various sections. This platform
              will serve for announcements, important club matters, and combined
              activities, ensuring everyone remains informed. We also welcome
              questions or clarifications from members that could benefit the
              broader club community—excluding personal matters. Our goal is to
              foster open communication and transparency within our club.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I’d like to take this moment to congratulate all award recipients,
              and our newly elected captains and other office bearers recognized
              at the AGM on October 20, 2024.
            </p>

              A warm thank you to Inigo Bridle (Club Chairman), Andy Colley

              other committee members on November 7, 2024.

              As I settle into this role, I’m eager to hear your feedback,

              Since this is our first newsletter, it may be a bit longer than
              future ones, but I trust it will be valuable for everyone. In
              future editions, we’ll aim to keep things concise and focused.

              the Selection committee. Feedback has been varied, and so far, we
              haven’t received a clear consensus on the best approach. To
              address this, I have scheduled a meeting with all team captains
              and vice-captains on 15th November 2024. The main purpose of this
              meeting will be to discuss the role of a selection committee and
              gather initial insights from our leadership.

                    As part of our initiative to install outdoor nets, we
                    reached out to nearly 50 chairpersons of Cheshire County
                    League (CCL) registered cricket clubs to gather information
                    on vendors they have used for net installations or any
                    recommendations they might have. We received responses from
                    about 10 chairpersons, all of whom were very supportive and
                    shared helpful insights.

                    We have contacted several vendors, and at this stage,
                    Totalplay and Dura Cricket have provided initial quotes.
                    Totalplay is scheduled to conduct a site visit on 19th Nov
                    2024 at 2 pm to assess our needs, while Dura Cricket has
                    shared a range of options for us to consider. Once we decide
                    on our preferred specifications, they will proceed with a

                      <strong>Location:</strong> Proximity to hard standing and

                      health and safety and ease of transporting kit.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Orientation:</strong> The facility must face in a
                      North-South direction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Ease of build:</strong> The closer to hard
                      standing, the easier it is to construct in any weather
                      without additional costs like haul roads.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Levels:</strong> The facility requires a level,
                      flat, well-drained area to construct a stable foundation.

                    If you are looking to secure funding from “official” bodies
                    such as The ECB and Sport England, they will request that
                    the club seek planning permission. We feel that this is best
                    practice regardless of funding avenue.

                        While these figures may seem high, they reflect current
                        market rates. Many clubs that installed nets over a
                        decade ago secured ECB funding to offset costs. However,
                        priorities have shifted towards supporting junior
                        cricket, especially for girls and women. Since our club
                        lacks a junior section, this presents a challenge: we
                        need facilities to attract juniors, but funding is
                        difficult to secure without a junior program. We’ll
                        continue researching and exploring options.
